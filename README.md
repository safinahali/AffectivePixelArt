# AffectivePixelArt

## Pixel art stuff
- Currently uses video stream and forms particles with noise
- Use the images from the folder you create from google-image-download instead of video stream
- Change particle properties, force, acceleration to make the perlin stuff in the mirror_pix.js file
- The affdex stuff is currently sitting inside the html file, feel free to organize it, make a new js file. 
- Use the [art parameters sheet](https://docs.google.com/a/andrew.cmu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1sMEO8zEOIgmsorEUKfX7ZuyaTUC0Gra1PdSQ-_f_GhQ/edit?usp=sharing) -  for aesthetic emotion relationships if you want.
- Use the sketch in 'flowfield_from_image' folder for the flow field stuff. Preview [here] (https://github.com/safinahali/AffectivePixelArt/blob/master/flowfields_from_images/index.html).
